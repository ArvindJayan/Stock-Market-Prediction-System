This repository contains a Python-based system designed to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. The system focuses on analyzing historical stock data to forecast future trends, aiming for a prediction accuracy of approximately 60%.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes web scraping to gather historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and extracts relevant features for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of historical data and prediction outcomes.
- **User Interface**: Includes a Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) for interactive exploration and model execution.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
